I created Object Entities directory inside Entites directory beause objects are
also entities, nonliving entities. But I'm not sure how we would want to render
objects that's why I don't see any appropriate place for them. We might want to
put them outside the Entities directory because objects have different
characteristics.
Same goes for honeycomb hexa blocks. Different properties and different rendering.

Objects are as follows:
    Flowers -> different flowers, sizes, colors etc
    Trees -> different trees, sizes, colors etc
    Stones -> different stones, sizes, colors etc
Also:
    Honeycomb cells -> hexa blocks, different sizes, colors etc
